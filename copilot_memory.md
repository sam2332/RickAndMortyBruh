# Rick and Morty RimWorld Mod

## Portal Gun Harmony Patch Issue - FIXED ✓

### Problem Analysis:
The mod was throwing a `TypeInitializationException` with "Null method for RickAndMortyBruh.PortalLoSPatch" error, indicating that Harmony couldn't find the methods we were trying to patch with the specified signatures.

### Root Cause:
1. **Ambiguous Method Matching**: `GenSight.LineOfSight` has multiple overloads in RimWorld
2. **Incorrect Parameter Types**: Some of the parameter types we specified didn't match the actual method signatures
3. **Over-complicated Approach**: We were trying to patch too many methods at once

### Solution Implemented:
1. **Simplified Harmony Patches**: 
   - Removed all problematic patches for `GenSight.LineOfSight`, `GenSight.LineOfSightToEdges`, and `GenUI.TargetsAt`
   - Kept only the essential `Verb.TryFindShootLineFromTo` patch which is sufficient for portal gun functionality
   - Added proper error handling and logging to the static constructor

2. **Removed Flag-based System**: 
   - Eliminated the `isUsingPortalGun` flag approach
   - Simplified the verb override methods to work independently
   - This reduces complexity and potential race conditions

3. **Direct Verb Overrides**:
   - `ValidateTarget()`: Uses custom validator that ignores line of sight
   - `CanHitTarget()`: Always returns true for valid cells and pawns
   - `CanHitTargetFrom()`: Always returns true for in-bounds targets
   - `TryCastShot()`: Handles teleportation and vaporization directly

### Key Changes:
- **RickPortalLineOfSightPatch.cs**: Simplified to only patch `TryFindShootLineFromTo` with proper error handling
- **Verb_CastAbilityRickPortal.cs**: Removed all flag management, simplified override methods
- Portal gun now works through the verb's built-in overrides rather than global patches
